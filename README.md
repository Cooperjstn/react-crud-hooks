# React CRUD App with Hooks.

*Built an React CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) App to demonstrate the capabilities of Hooks in React. For those who don't know, Hooks was added in React 16.8. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Official documentation is [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)*.

My App is located here on [GitHub Pages](https://cooperjstn.github.io/react-crud-hooks/).
